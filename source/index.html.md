# Introduction

> API Endpoint

```
https://api.vtion.ai/v1
```
Welcome to the Vtion API! Vtion powers visual search for eCommerce and retail. Using Vtion proprietary AI technology,
 we enable retailers with image recognition solutions from a camera button to image to text technology, in order to create a more engaged, 
 interactive and data-driven omnichannel experience.
                             
We have language bindings in Shell, PHP, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
